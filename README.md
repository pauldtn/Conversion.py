This Python script demonstrates basic variable type conversions in Python. The goal is to showcase how different data types can be converted from one type to another using Python's built-in functions. The script deals with converting numerical values to integers and floats, and strings to integers, and vice versa.

Features
Numerical and String Conversions: Converts numbers to strings, integers to floats, and strings to integers.
Print Conversion Results: Outputs the result of each conversion to the console, providing a clear understanding of how the conversion affects the value.
Code Description
The script includes the following steps:

Variable Declarations:

num1, num2, num3: Variables declared with numerical values.
string1: A variable declared with a string value representing a number.
Type Conversions:

num1 is converted from a float to an integer using the int() function. The result is stored in int_num1.
num2 is converted from an integer to a float using the float() function. The result is stored in float_num2.
num3 is converted from an integer to a string using the str() function. The result is stored in str_num3.
string1 is converted from a string to an integer using the int() function. The result is stored in int_string1.
Printing Results:

The script prints the results of each conversion to the console. This helps in understanding the output of each type conversion operation.
Usage
This script can be used as a learning tool for understanding type conversion in Python. It is also useful for anyone who needs to perform type conversion between integers, floats, and strings in their Python programs.

To run the script, simply execute it in a Python environment. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
